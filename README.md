# Apollo REST Data Sources with the Countries API

This demo shows how you can use Apollo's REST Data Sources package to wrap a REST API with a GraphQL Server. For more on REST Data Sources, [check out the docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/data/data-sources/).

Setup:

```
git clone https://github.com/moonhighway/countries-datasources
cd countries-datasources
npm i
npm start
```

You'll find the server running on `localhost:4000`.
